## tart-lab — Provision Tart VMs with Ansible

Minimal Ansible project to clone and configure macOS/tart VMs from a base image, in order to quickly spin up a small cluster (e.g., Kubernetes master/worker) or utility VMs.

ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml
ansible-playbook playbooks/configure.yml --ask-become-pass
ansible-playbook playbooks/stop.yml
ansible-playbook playbooks/remove.yml
